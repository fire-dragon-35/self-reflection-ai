# Reflektion

**AI-powered self-reflection for understanding your patterns and personality.**

## What is Reflektion?

Reflektion helps you understand yourself through conversations with AI. Reflect on your thoughts, explore your patterns, and discover insights about your personality and how you relate to others.

**Not therapy. Not journaling. Self-knowledge.**

## ✨ Why Reflektion?

- **🔒 Fully encrypted** - All conversations and insights are private.
- **👤 Anonymous** - No name or email required. Just sign in and start.
- **📖 Open source** - Audit the code on GitHub.
- **🧠 Deep insights** - Discover your Big Five personality traits and attachment style (more to come later)
- **📊 Track growth** - See how you're evolving over time.
- **💼 Exportable data** - Share collected summaries and analyses with a real therapist.
